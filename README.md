Those are the algorithms pick away from INF552 Machine Learning @USC


For each machine learning:  
First I implements it by myself and test the scripts on real data.  
Second I use package which has the same function to test the same data in order to confirm the result of my algorithm is right and compare the performance between my programing and package. 
Finally, I try to improve my implemention if my preformance is low.
